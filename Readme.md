## How to use it

To use the function:
- go to:`cd examples`
- run: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra main.c ../Libft/libft.a ../get_next_line.c`
- execute: `./a.out example.txt` or `./a.out example2.txt`

**NB:**
In the main you have 2 tests possible (to get all the file or only five line)
example.txt is a short text, example2 is way more longer
